# Feedback on Final

You did a solid job on your final project, combining data from multiple sources and trying to draw some conclusions.  It demonstrated your Python skills well.  Using Python classes wasn't necessary, but it demonstrated that you were doing learning outside of the class.

One of the expectations for the final project was that it should have some real world applicability, especially in healthcare. I didn't see that in your work.

I would have liked to see more explanation throughout the notebook on why you were doing what you were doing, and what you thought the next steps should accomplish. Some of your comments simply describe what the code is doing, but they don't explain why that step needed to be done.  (-5 Documentation / Professionalism)
